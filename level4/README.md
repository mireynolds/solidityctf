## Level 4 notes
This solution requires deploying both contracts. You then need to submit both contracts as solutions in the order tx1, tx2 within the same block. See level 2 notes for why this works! The crux of it is: tx1 contract stores the correct value, tx2 is an empty contract - the value has already been stored on submission of tx1.. provided they are in the same block. :-)
